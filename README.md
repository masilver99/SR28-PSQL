# SR28-PSQL
Postgres script for the USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, release 28

COPY command in the script will have to be updated with the location of the usda csv files (ending in .txt).

One file, NUT_DATA.7z must be unzipped using 7zip first.  It was too large for GitHub.  I may zip all the files at a later date for consistency.

Also, you can see a sample of the database at work here:  http://findnutrition.org.
